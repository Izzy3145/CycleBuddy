# Cycle Buddy

Cycle Buddy was built as the Capstone Project of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree.

This project aims to bring together everything learned in the Android Developer Nanodegree, and follows a detailed design and planning document (authored by myself).

In addition to concepts learned in the Nanodegree, this app uses Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Storage and Admob, along with various third-party libraries.

# The idea behind the app
The concept occurred to me as a London cyclist many years ago, and I'm glad to have made a fully functioning app around it. 

Many people in London would like to begin cycling in London but are too scared or don't know where to start. This app is a social platform that gives less confident cyclists the opportunity to contact more experienced cyclists, or buddies, with the intention of meeting up and cycling together in order to build cycling confidence. Users can offer or search routes to share, and use the messaging function to begin the process


Cycle Buddy can be found on the Google Play Store.
